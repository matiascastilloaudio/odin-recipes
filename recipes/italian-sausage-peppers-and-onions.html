    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 (4 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ medium red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium green bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

            skillet, and slice.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the same skillet. Stir in onions and garlic, and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in bell peppers,

            are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return sausage slices to the skillet. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, or until sausage is
            heated through, adding more wine if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
